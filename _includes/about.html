                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a computational ecologist interested in imaging biology, mechanistic modelling, and spider web traits.</p>
                <p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Imperial College London, working on the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/250073/new-gather-data-diseases-spread-mosquitoes/">One Health Vector-Borne Diseases Hub</a>. Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor's in Zoology at the University of Leeds followed by my Master's degree in Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE) and PhD at Imperial College London.</p>
