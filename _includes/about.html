                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a computational ecologist interested in imaging biology, mechanistic modelling, and spider web traits.</p>
                <p>I am currently in the final year of my PhD in the biodiversity lab led by James Rosindell at Imperial College London. I am presently funded by NERC as a part of the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/qmee-cdt/">QMEE CDT</a> program. Prior to this I earned my Bachelor's in Zoology at the University of Leeds and my Master's degree at Imperial College London in Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE).</p>
                <p>I am currently looking for postdoctoral opportunities starting in the Summer of 2024.</p>
