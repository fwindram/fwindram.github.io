                <h2>Research Interests</h2>
                    <p>My research investigates a wide variety of topics broadly within the realm of computational ecology and imaging biology. Currently my focus is predominantly on spider web imaging and web traits.</p>
                    <p>My work is predominantly theoretical and computational, but usually includes elements of lab and fieldwork as the empirical basis. I look to improve current methods of data generation, analysis, and visualisation, incorporating my experience as a graphic designer and in software development.</p>
                <h3>Novel imaging methods</h3>
                    <p>Imaging is an important technique in ecology and in biology more generally. Camera trapping, camouflage and biomimicry, vision, colouration, and structural analysis all have major elements of image generation and analysis. I am very interested in designing and testing new methods to extract this sort of data in the field and the lab, with a current focus on spider web imaging. In my recent paper "Improving in-situ spider web photography with UV fluorescence" (in review), we developed a modification to the established night-sampling techniques used to photograph spider webs in the field. We exploited the phenomenon of UV fluorescence to force only areas of interest to glow in the visible light spectrum while excluding any light reflected from the background using UV filters. This notably improved Weber contrast within photos, leading to much better distinction between webs and their background.</p>

Some light hits the web and is re-emitted in the visible spectrum (depicted as an orange solid wave). This light passes through a UV filter before being captured by a camera. Other light passes through the web and reflects off the background, staying the same wavelength and getting stopped by the UV filter.">
                <h3>Heuristic image analysis</h3>
                    <p>I take a predominantly mechanistic approach to image analysis, starting from the physical fundamentals of how the features of an image have come to exist and using that knowledge to design analysis that extracts the traits we are interested in. Part of my current work in my PhD focuses on automating the process of extracting functional traits from images of spider webs. This has historically been a slow and manual process, but we are now seeing speedups of close to 52x for digitisation outputs that are additionally more data-rich.</p>
